# 5 Levels of Ignorance in Modern Web Development
Despite the fact of me not being a professional web developer yet, I do have a fair share of knowledge on the topic. In this article, I want to mention the annoyance of sophisticated web developers — about what they know — compared to the ignorance of the new and unexperienced.  
Please do not be offended by any of the claims I make. My intentions are just to inform you with topics that need improvement.

## Design — Don't follow the rules
I myself am a graduated graphic designer that progressively made a turn towards web development, with web design being a main focus.  
One thing that drew my attention when entering this business, is the amount of rules that so called 'web designers' apply when producing a styleguide, architecture or layout. Design isn't something one can be taught, it must be learned via experience in the field, by learning from your own mistakes.

When a set of rules is applied (i.e. a maximum allowed width of paragraphs, or that every colour contrast must exceed a 4.5-rating on [Lea Verou's Constrast Ratio Check](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/)) the designer isn't left with much freedom. Sure, there are times where a maximum paragraph width is needed and where a high contrast is existential, but it depends very much on the context the designer is given per objective.

## (JavaScript) Frameworks — Redundancy achieved 
Starting developers immediately want to get to the good stuff in making web applications, meaning they will set their focus to choosing a framework or library that's suitable for development. Most of the work will be handled by the chosen bundle of code, this way. Though this approach seems quite reasonable, however, it's not. By assigning tasks to a third party framework/library, the developer is not really paying attention on the stuff he/she is creating. Sooner or later this will cause troubles, in which the developer doesn't know how to proceed or fix even the most basic thing.

It's far better for starting developers to learn vanilla JavaScript, to eventually reach a point where he/she doesn't even consider using a framework/library, because it's contextually more efficient to use less code for the job in question. There will never be a usecase where the entirety of the framework/library will be used.  
Whether the developer called to focus on an object-oriented or a functional approach, vanilla code is more efficient, effective and scalable per case. This especially applies in the long run, where maintenance issues a decade away can be resolved more quickly with vanilla code compared to framework/library code.

## Performance — Every millisecond counts
With the introduction of fiber networks and the new 4G mobile standard, one should expect that the overall speed is exponentially increased, and it is, though not everywhere. It's a common misconception that speedy internet is the norm around the globe, or even thirty minutes from my hometown; one that I personally fell for as well.  
Fiber networks are not integrated fully, yet. As of 2016, only 11% of the total percentage of bandwidth subscriptions in the United States were from fiber networks (Felix Richter, 2016). With mobile devices, the same can be said: Not everyone has the opportunity to enjoy the speed that comes with a 4G network, some have browse with 3G or even 2G connections. Even some (public) Wi-Fi networks can perform poorly.
