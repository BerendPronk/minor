# 5 Levels of Ignorance in Modern Web Development
Despite the fact of me not being a professional web developer yet, I do have a fair share of knowledge on the topic. In this article, I want to mention the annoyance of sophisticated web developers — about what they know — compared to the ignorance of the new and unexperienced.  
Please do not be offended by any of the claims I make. My intentions are just to inform you with topics that need improvement.

## Design — Don't follow the rules
I myself am a graduated graphic designer that progressively made a turn towards web development, with web design being a main focus.  
One thing that drew my attention when entering this business, is the amount of rules that so called 'web designers' apply when producing a styleguide, architecture or layout. Design isn't something one can be taught, it must be learned via experience in the field, by learning from your own mistakes.
When a set of rules is applied (i.e. a maximum allowed width of paragraphs, or that every colour contrast must exceed a 4.5-rating on [Lea Verou's Constrast Ratio Check](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/)) the designer isn't left with much freedom. Sure, there are times where a maximum paragraph width is needed and where a high contrast is existential, but it depends very much on the context the designer is given per objective.
