# My Mechanical Mansion

Not long ago I was introduced with the Internet of Things (IoT) and it's potential. Like many other technological revolutions, I was skeptical about it's goal and general purpose. Why would anyone want to connect every household item with each other?  
According to John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco, the IoT-market could be worth $19 trillion (Connie Guglielmo, 2014).

## Veni
I guess I always have been late with adopting to technological innovations. Though I was the first in school in possession of a personal cellphone, I was the last to take the leap to owning a smartphone. Now I almost can't imagine living without one.
The same principle applied to my experiences of IoT-technology. At first I could not understand how anyone found any added use in a lightbulb or a juice press that's connected to the web. But that was about to change.

## Vidi
Among the redundant connected 'things' I saw, there were actual some hidden gems. When it comes to safety, and change forwards is good. Alphabet's Nest is a good example. With their 'smart' smoke detectors and thermostats they grew large as a company worldwide. They also produce both indoor and outdoor camera's that are always recording, allowing the owner to monitor his house at any given time and location, improving on the user's overall security.
I myself would not mind owning devices with those, or similar properties in the future.

It makes me think about the systems one can build with existing IoT-technology. I believe we are already ways ahead of what we though was possible, a few years ago. Experimenting with IoT will probably turn in a new hobby of mine, whenever I own a house/apartment that fully belongs to me. Though some concepts still won't receive any attention from my part. I guess I will never find any use in connected devices that don't have a significant addition to their initial functionalities. Sure, remote controlled lightbulbs would be nifty, but that's not what I'm interested in. I can just as easily walk to the switches attached to the wall. My main focus lies with unique ways to optimize efficiency in my own living situation.

## 'Vici'
Although my current understanding of the technology will form a block in the road, it wouldn't prevent me from trying out new things and learn from my errors.

How nice would it be if my house knows the genre of music I like at certain parts of the day, like when I cook, for instance. And how nice would it be if the same music automatically plays in the background whenever I turn on the stove, activating the cooker hood and increasing the brightness of the room simultaneously.
It is concepts like these that triggered my interest in IoT the most. Multiple sensors are required for this automation to function as planned. Sensors are relatively cheap, and the prices continue to drop. It is estimated that the average price will stand at just $0.38 a piece by the year 2020 (Goldman Sachs and BI Intelligence, 2016).

As much as I'd love a fully automated situation in my house, I don't want to be out of control. Sensors are not a fully reliable: They might have trouble detecting changes it's supposed to, and they also wear down. You see, if a sensor were to suddenly break at one point, or if the installed system isn't able to handle an overload and crashes, I need to modifications to the system and reset it; perhaps stripping out an entire wall in the process.  
That's why a control center would fit me best, activating a series of electronical processes with just a single flick of a switch.

Please do try to experiment with this technology yourself. When you doubt your technological knowledge, don't worry: There are a lot of devices and services out there that'll do a lot of the work for you. Start your experience with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), a service that allows you to connect IoT-electronics to the apps you have on your phone, and be creative.
