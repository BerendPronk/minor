# The Rising Free Network
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast growing technology that connects everything to the web. The possibilities in connections is endless. Whether you want to connect a doorbell to your phone, or want to know the exact location of you parked bike, IoT-technology makes it happen. IoT still isn't widely spread around the globe, but we're seeing more and more developments popping out. Soon our cars will talk to each other, in order to check if all conditions are safe. This will start with security, to eventually overtake all driver's responsibilities entirely, evolving into self-driving cars which we already hear about today.  
The world as we currently know it will progressively change by the following years, with self-driving cars only being a proving example of it.

## The future home of today
There have been numerous innovations within IoT the past few years. Modern homes have smart smoke detectors, smart energymeters, and assistants like Google Home, Amazon Echo and the forthcoming Apple HomePod. Everything will soon be connected to the internet in order to help people manage their homes.  
However, these 'smart' configurations are all connected to the same network, the one located in the house itself. Meaning the connectedness of devices can't exceed the length of one's own garden. This currently is the limit, as far as mainstream IoT goes. But there are some major developments around the corner, which are expanding faster than one might think.

## The LoRa-network
There is a new type of signal in the air. Long Range Radio (LoRa) is a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN), a wireless telecommunications network designed to allow low bitrate datastreams (0.3kbit/s to 50kbit/s) over a range between 2.5km and 15km (Arnoud Wokke, 2015). An Amsterdam business uses this LoRa-technology to create a global free-to-use network, whitin a month's time they already covered the entire city of Amsterdam (The Things Network, 2015). And as of this writing, only two years after the project has launced, there are coverages in major cities in every continent of our globe, meaning this technology rises at a fast rate.

The long-range radio network allow every connection to be bi-directional, meaning the connected thing (end-device) can both send and receive data, though very small bits at the time. End-devices work on battery and are placed all over the world, for experimentation and real use. To lower stress on the battery of end-devices, the LPWAN-network powering LoRa is equipped with an adaptive data-rate scheme. This makes sure every end-device is handled individually and that the radio-frequency is regulated per connected thing, either. This saves both battery life on end-devices and overall network capacity (LoRa Alliance, n.d.).

Everyone interested can be part of this revolution by investing in a '[The Things Gateway](https://shop.thethingsnetwork.com/index.php/product/the-things-gateway/)', which is basically a router between the connected devices and the internet.
