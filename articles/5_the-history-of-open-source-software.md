# The History of Open Source Software
In contrast to 'closed' software, open source software consists of software products where the source code is made available for public use. This code, and thus the software itself, is free for everyone to make changes to.

It all began with a revolutionary change in the philisophy of software development. Founded by Richard Stallman, the 'Free software' movement is a globally-active social movement with the objective of obtaining a set of defined freedoms for all software users.  
Free software doesn't necessarily mean that the software is free to use, though. Maintenance, support and updates could have an attached pricetag. The word 'free' in english is ambiguous, and has multiple meanings. One of which is 'zero price', like with the shopping campaigns where you receive a third product for free if you bought two in total. And the other meaning refers to the fact that you have freedom (Hannu Puttonen, 2001). 

## Four essential freedoms of free software
The following list consists of the freedoms one should have when using software. This list was conducted by Stallman himself in 1996.

- **1:** The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- **2:** The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- **3:** The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
- **4:** The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

## GNU
In 1983 Stallman started working an a new project, the GNU (GNU's Not Unix) project. An operating system that would be build with his philosophy — of free from constraints source code — in mind. The decision to begin this project, and the whole movement of free software, happend after an incident with a Xerox printer that wouldn't function as intended. Stallman wasn't able to make his own changes to the software, because it was restricted by the company that procude it (Richard Stallman, 2001).

A lot of work was done on the GNU project in the 1980's, but there still wasn't any active kernel on the system yet. In the beginning of 1990, GNU's newsletter said: "We aren't doing any kernel work. It does not make sense for us to start a kernel project now" (*GNU Hurd/ history*, n.d.).

## Linux
In 1991 the open source kernel Linux was released, built by Linus Torvalds. At this time, the GNU operating system was about to be completed, the only thing that was left to add, was a fitting kernel. Stallman eventually decided to use Linux for his operating system (David Pakman, 2017).  
Linux continued development and is currently the largest collaborative development project in history. The numbers are staggering:

- Over 850,000 Android devices (which run Linux) are activated each day.
- Most of the 700,000 televisions being sold each day, are running Linux.
- 9 out of 10 supercomputers are running Linux.
- The servers of Google, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon all run Linux.

(The Linux Foundation, 2012).

The fact that Linux is open source means developers are free to access the source code, making changes to eventually request these to be added in the main kernel itself. This collaborative way of development makes Linux, and open source software in general, a good alternative to 'closed' software, where only one party is in control.

## Git
Git is a version control system released in 2005. This piece of software was also made by Linus Torvalds. Based on the then already existing BitKeeper, Torvalds wanted to create his own version control software, though with some improvements on BitKeeper as objective. He wanted speed to be one of the primary features of the system. A simple design was important, there needed to be strong support for non-linear development (a myriad of parallel branches/versions of projects) and everything needed to be fully distributed.  
Above all that, he desired the software to be able to handle large projects like, the Linux kernel, efficiently (*1.2 Getting Started - A Short History of Git*, n.d.).

## Future
Who knows what the future will bring, anything seems to be possible. Maybe all software will eventually turn open source. According to the further reading in the resources below, it seems to be a good improvement for people's rights and privacy.
