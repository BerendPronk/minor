# The History of Open Source Software
In contrast to 'closed' software, open source software consists of software products where the source code made available for public use. This code, and thus the software itself, is free for everyone to make changes to. That's why it's also sometimes referred to as 'Free Software'. This doesn't necessarily mean that the software is free to use, though. Maintenance, support and updates could have an attached pricetag. The word 'free' in english is ambiguous, and has multiple meanings. One of which is the 'zero price', like with the shopping campaigns where you received a third product for free if you bought two in total. And the other meaning refers to the fact that you have freedom (Richard Stallman, 2001).
