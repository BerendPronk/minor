##February 7th, 2017 - Stephen Hay

The user experience consultant Stephen Hay was invited to speak to us about his expertise. Design, that is. More specifically; design for the web. Also author of a book about this topic, called: 'Responsive Design Workflow'.

He introduced himself by mentioning the location he natively comes from, California USA. He lived there till the year 1992, when he came to The Netherlands to live in Leeuwarden.
Stephen talked about his studies in art and graphic design, and that his dad was not very fond of that choice.

He works at the online auctionhouse Catawiki, to inprove the overall usability of the system. Some of the more important aspects of internal guidelines of such a project are color, type and readability, so users are not troubled when using the platform. Another thing he explicitly mentioned, was context. Context is key in (re)designing websites. "If a rubber duck can understand your point, your story is good enough," he said, winking to us (future) developers.

Developers and designers are, according to Stephen, not communication well enough. They need to be on the same level in the team to prevent mistakes that might be needed to get fixed in the future.
For a better feel for the project, he suggested that both designers and developers should work within the browser as soon as possible. It should also all be done with the mobile-first approach, so it's easier to see what's important. A useful tip he gave: Find a suitiable breakpoint based on resizing the viewport, instead of choosing screen-widths of devices, since there just are too many of them.

Stephen ended his talk by answering some quick-questions, besides the 'bigger' questions we had at the beginning that resulted in the story descripted here.

##February 14th, 2017 - Justus Sturkenboom

One of the lecturers of the University of Applied sciences, and my coach of the year prior to this minor, Justus Sturkenboom wanted to give us multiple tips about the benefits of sketchnoting. Not only that; he tackled the tools necessary for sketching notes of great quality.

He started out by giving us a short story on the history of sketchnoting, where the principle came from and how it is applied today. Why sketchnoting is better than writing regular notes came by as well. Where both sides of the brain are working together to memorize the note more effectively.

Sketching does not equal to drawing. He made that very clear by letting us sketch some objects he presented on the beamer. At first he gave us a full minute to draw a cake. Everyone involved tried to make a drawing that represents the shown cake as best they could.
The lesson here was about the drawing: It wasn't needed to draw that exact cake, only the key-aspects of the cake were needed for the sketch to be effective.
Justus gave us another try to sketch the cake, but now we had 25 seconds total. This repeated itself until we only had 5 seconds to sketch a cake. At the end, everyone was able to sketch a cake with just a few lines and shapes.
Lines and shapes are very important in sketchnoting, since combining them could result in every possible form you can think of.

Highlighting within the sketchnotes are a great way to emphasize, he said. By providing important text with a thicker stroke, it'll be easier to see hierarchy in the notes. This can also be done with different styles of typography, or with arrows, bubbles or frames.

But sketching takes time, and it is important to also listen to the speaker. It is impossible to do two things at once, right? That's were planning comes in to play. Research the speakers topics before the presentation, to give yourself a sense of what's about to come, Justus mentioned.
It can also come in handy to provide the notebook some layout beforehand, so all you have left to do is to fill it in with the sketched information from the speaker.

About the equipment every sketchnoter needs: It's important to use pens, markers and paper that you are comfortable with. There are no strict guidelines for it, but Justus said it's good to always have a marker, two highlighters (grey and a bright colour), a fineliner, a notebook with thick paper and something to store everything in.

Justus can talk very fast. He proved that once again by finishing his presenation in 45 minutes, where he planned to speak 90 minutes total. However, everything he said was clear and very useful to apply in later presentations.

##February 28th, 2017 - Peter Paul Koch

The initial speaker of this Weekly Nerd was unable to give a presentation, so we received more of an improvised talk by someone else, instead.
The name of the speaker was Peter Paul Koch, a front-end developer and founder of Fronteers.

He didn't have much time to prepare a presentation for us, so he needed to improvise a bit by giving us a list of problems with web development he often speaks about in his other talks.
Despite the fact that he improvised with us, it still was very interesting to see the passion this man has for his job. About how he knows everything about certain topics, and knows how to present it to us student developers with a lot of humour.

The list he provided us with, consisted of four items. Actually he mentioned there are five of them, but that he needed to come back sometime to explain the final one.

Peter said that web developers tend to emulate native apps in web appliations, which is not advised. Because of the fact that native apps control the standard that web apps are trying to head to, native apps will always have a 'lead' on them, in terms of performance and functionalities.

His second flaw with web development was about the many features browsers currently have. Browser development is stuck in the feature focus, where they try their best to concentrate on what the user needs. Instead they need to carry on with development and enter the experience focus, where the user experience is the main goal.

Another flaw he mentioned, are the tools developers use. Developers need to understand vanilla code, instead of relying on frameworks, taskrunners and helpers.

The fourth and final flaw Peter used in his presentation was all about the different kinds of web platforms. People often think that there are just a few web platforms, when there are actually thousands. Every individual browser on every phone should be counted as an unique web platform. Therefore it is important to test on multiple browsers and devices of all sorts, in order to get a grip on the effectiveness of your written code.

All of the flaws Peter talked about enhance eachother, like a chain consisting of problems. When a developer tackles one of these problems, it should be easier to get rid of the others as well.

After about on hour he gave us the opportunity to ask him some questions about the talk and his expertise. Overall it was a very impressive presentation which was accurate in terms of information to our minor.
