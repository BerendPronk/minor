# Minor: Web Development - Weekly Nerd Blog

## February 7th, 2017 - Stephen Hay

The user experience consultant Stephen Hay was invited to speak to us about his expertise. Design, that is. More specifically; design for the web. Also author of a book about this topic, called: 'Responsive Design Workflow'.

He introduced himself by mentioning the location he natively comes from, California USA. He lived there till the year 1992, when he came to The Netherlands to live in Leeuwarden.
Stephen talked about his studies in art and graphic design, and that his dad was not very fond of that choice.

He works at the online auctionhouse Catawiki, to inprove the overall usability of the system. Some of the more important aspects of internal guidelines of such a project are color, type and readability, so users are not troubled when using the platform. Another thing he explicitly mentioned, was context. Context is key in (re)designing websites. "If a rubber duck can understand your point, your story is good enough," he said, winking to us (future) developers.

Developers and designers are, according to Stephen, not communication well enough. They need to be on the same level in the team to prevent mistakes that might be needed to get fixed in the future.
For a better feel for the project, he suggested that both designers and developers should work within the browser as soon as possible. It should also all be done with the mobile-first approach, so it's easier to see what's important. A useful tip he gave: Find a suitiable breakpoint based on resizing the viewport, instead of choosing screen-widths of devices, since there just are too many of them.

Stephen ended his talk by answering some quick-questions, besides the 'bigger' questions we had at the beginning that resulted in the story descripted here.

## February 14th, 2017 - Justus Sturkenboom

One of the lecturers of the University of Applied sciences, and my coach of the year prior to this minor, Justus Sturkenboom wanted to give us multiple tips about the benefits of sketchnoting. Not only that; he tackled the tools necessary for sketching notes of great quality.

He started out by giving us a short story on the history of sketchnoting, where the principle came from and how it is applied today. Why sketchnoting is better than writing regular notes came by as well. Where both sides of the brain are working together to memorize the note more effectively.

Sketching does not equal to drawing. He made that very clear by letting us sketch some objects he presented on the beamer. At first he gave us a full minute to draw a cake. Everyone involved tried to make a drawing that represents the shown cake as best they could.
The lesson here was about the drawing: It wasn't needed to draw that exact cake, only the key-aspects of the cake were needed for the sketch to be effective.
Justus gave us another try to sketch the cake, but now we had 25 seconds total. This repeated itself until we only had 5 seconds to sketch a cake. At the end, everyone was able to sketch a cake with just a few lines and shapes.
Lines and shapes are very important in sketchnoting, since combining them could result in every possible form you can think of.

Highlighting within the sketchnotes are a great way to emphasize, he said. By providing important text with a thicker stroke, it'll be easier to see hierarchy in the notes. This can also be done with different styles of typography, or with arrows, bubbles or frames.

But sketching takes time, and it is important to also listen to the speaker. It is impossible to do two things at once, right? That's were planning comes in to play. Research the speakers topics before the presentation, to give yourself a sense of what's about to come, Justus mentioned.
It can also come in handy to provide the notebook some layout beforehand, so all you have left to do is to fill it in with the sketched information from the speaker.

About the equipment every sketchnoter needs: It's important to use pens, markers and paper that you are comfortable with. There are no strict guidelines for it, but Justus said it's good to always have a marker, two highlighters (grey and a bright colour), a fineliner, a notebook with thick paper and something to store everything in.

Justus can talk very fast. He proved that once again by finishing his presenation in 45 minutes, where he planned to speak 90 minutes total. However, everything he said was clear and very useful to apply in later presentations.

## February 28th, 2017 - Peter Paul Koch

The initial speaker of this Weekly Nerd was unable to give a presentation, so we received more of an improvised talk by someone else, instead.
The name of the speaker was Peter Paul Koch, a front-end developer and founder of Fronteers.

He didn't have much time to prepare a presentation for us, so he needed to improvise a bit by giving us a list of problems with web development he often speaks about in his other talks.
Despite the fact that he improvised with us, it still was very interesting to see the passion this man has for his job. About how he knows everything about certain topics, and knows how to present it to us student developers with a lot of humour.

The list he provided us with, consisted of four items. Actually he mentioned there are five of them, but that he needed to come back sometime to explain the final one.

Peter said that web developers tend to emulate native apps in web appliations, which is not advised. Because of the fact that native apps control the standard that web apps are trying to head to, native apps will always have a 'lead' on them, in terms of performance and functionalities.

His second flaw with web development was about the many features browsers currently have. Browser development is stuck in the feature focus, where they try their best to concentrate on what the user needs. Instead they need to carry on with development and enter the experience focus, where the user experience is the main goal.

Another flaw he mentioned, are the tools developers use. Developers need to understand vanilla code, instead of relying on frameworks, taskrunners and helpers.

The fourth and final flaw Peter used in his presentation was all about the different kinds of web platforms. People often think that there are just a few web platforms, when there are actually thousands. Every individual browser on every phone should be counted as an unique web platform. Therefore it is important to test on multiple browsers and devices of all sorts, in order to get a grip on the effectiveness of your written code.

All of the flaws Peter talked about enhance eachother, like a chain consisting of problems. When a developer tackles one of these problems, it should be easier to get rid of the others as well.

After about on hour he gave us the opportunity to ask him some questions about the talk and his expertise. Overall it was a very impressive presentation which was accurate in terms of information to our minor.

## March 14th, 2017 - Titus Wormer

After a few weeks of playing around in with GitHub during the first semester of our minor, we received a lecture about the software itself.

Titus began his talk by showing a short video explaining the concept of Git, and upstreams in general. It featured a lot of metaphors, for us to get a good grip of the subject. The video was about the cookie recipe of some fictional grandma, and how family members were able to improve on it by creating branches on the recipes. Here they added their own ideas into the mix, following by a pull-request towards grandma.
If grandma were to like the addition, she would merge the idea into her own. If not, the newly created recipe would play a role in it's own fork of the recipe.

After the metaphorical cookie-part of the presentation, Titus discussed some basic history of Git, and how the principle of Open Source software came to be.
Anyone who came up with a good question would be rewarded with a fortune cookie, he said. He had some spare, since he recently bought two kilos of the stuff.

The final part of the presentation included a demonstration of using Git via the terminal. This is where the most questions emerged. That's understandable, since it was all text-based.
Titus didn't really have an example to show us. He decided to create a new repository to pull some files from, adjusting them and pushing them eventually.
During this session, he also briefly explained the more advanced principles like squashing and rebasing commits.

## March 21st - Jasper Moelker

The fourth Weekly Nerd was given by a front-end developer from De Voorhoede, Jasper Moelker, at the office he works in.
The topic of this presentation was Progressive Enhancement. A very broad topic, with key components to keep in mind when developing a website for the end-user. 

Jasper set the term 'Progressive Enhancement' against 'Graceful Degradation'. They basically are the same thing, but viewed from a different perspective. Progressive Enhancement ia about adding new features to improve on the user experience, but keeping the overal code readible to as many browsers as possible.
Graceful degredation is the same concept, but as viewed from the other side; removing new features without removing the way users experience the website/application.

To accomplish this, a developer needs to build layered experiences. Starting with a baseline, a developer should always make the application work with the functionalities built in with most systems. Only then can the developer focus on more 'acceptable' implementations, building extra efficiency on top of the baseline experience, with newer features that may not be supported on every system.
After that, the 'enjoyable' layer can be developed, putting a smile on the user's face.

Feature detection if a very important aspect of progressive enhancement, Jasper mentioned. Without it, the parser of an older browser might come across a functionality it does not fully understand, potentially breaking the entire application.

To put us to the test with the new knowledge we obtained, Jasper let us create a pattern primer, which is basically a detailed map of a pattern or feature. This primer needed to contain the explanation of our chosen pattern, along with an interaction flow and possible browser functionalities to improve on the concept of the pattern.
After about half an hour, Jasper collected everyone's sheet and we discussed them as a group.

## March 28th - Bram Duvigneau

The announcement of this talk was made at the start of the minor, and it sure was something to look forward to. Bram is a blind developer who is specialized in accessibility. He arrived accompabied by his guidance dog, which was able to sit quietly in the same spot for the entire presentation.

Bram began by showing the peripherals he needs in order to surf on, and develop for the web; consisting of a special keyboard for him to read with his fingers, and a screen reader.
By navigating to a few major websites, he demonstrated these tools with their practical use. In between these demonstrations, Bram mentioned WCAG and the importance of accessibility on the web in general. We were already taught multiple times in the past about the importance of this, but it was very good to hear it from someone who experiences annoyances related to this topic on a daily basis.

After his demonstrations, we had the opportunity to ask him some questions. He answered them really well, and taught us a lot more about accessability then we initially knew before his talk.

## April 11th - Niels Leenheer

It was that time again; time to listen to another installment of the Weekly Nerd presentations, while we all just started a new semester. We received a new set of courses to practise: Real-time Web and Web of Things. Both of which are about letting multiple devices communicate with  each other.

The speaker that came to taught us something was Niels Leenheer. He is an expert on the internet of things spectrum. He also is founder of [HTML5Test](http://www.html5test.com) and created [Salonhub](http://www.salonhub.nl).

With little introduction to the concept of the internet of things, Niels directly dove into the more technical details: What is necessary to set up a IoT-environment, how to set it up and what it could be used for in general.

One of the techniques Niels used for his projects, is called 'KlikAan-KlikUit' (SwitchOn-SwitchOff), a rather simple, not exciting way of dealing with IoT-development. It works with the transmission of data via a 433MHz-frequency channel, which allows the connected devices to communicate.
Another interesting technology within IoT, is called zWave. This enables the ability to create a mesh network that spans across multiple devices. This network is capable of achieving a greater reach than an ordinary Wi-Fi network. Every connected device will be a network hotspot, basically creating a chain of devices that depend on each other.

Niels also showed us some very interesting examples of IoT-projects he created himself.
He made a mailbox that lets him know when he receives mail, and created an add-on for his washing machine that lets him know his clothing is done when the Watt-usage recedes 5 Watt.
Niels is getting notified from these installations by, what I think is his most valueable creation, a Pixel notification  center, which is also capable of rendering monsters in real-time via an app.

Security of IoT-technologies are not the safest. Everyone that knows something about your setup, is able to manipulate the IoT-traffic, if not done properly.

A relatively short presentation, though very inspirational and packed with new terms, technologies and ideas.

## May 3rd - Eva-Lotta Lamm

Quite some time has passed since the latest Weekly Nerd. The presentation was not given in one of our available classrooms, but in the CMD-Medialounge, instead. Also, the talk was organized via Eventbrite and presented as an ICONS-meeting, so other students of the university could join.

The speaker of the event was Eva-Lotta Lamm, who is an expert in making sketchnotes.
There was a sign-language interpreter in front of the audience to translate everything that the speaker would say to a girl in the front row, who had lost her ability to hear.

After a short introduction of the previous experiences Eva-Lotta has faced in her career, she listed five essential guidelines for sketchnoting. This was done in a very clever way, where she projected a live video-feed of her actually sketching the guidelines with the techniques she wanted to teach us about. The feed was recorded, as well; so students that weren't able to join this event could rewatch it at a later date.

Almost everyone in the room sketched along with Eva-Lotta. It really was a nice way of following the presentation. Because she wasn't able to speak to fast and no one was distracted amd kept their attention on the beautiful drawinga she made.

The topic of this talk was similar to a previous Weekly Nerd, the one where Justus Sturkenboom shared his experiences with sketchnoting. Though a similar subject, both talks tackled different problems when it comes to sketchnoting. Where Justus focused more on the gear you should have, Eva-Lotta told us more on the different techniques people should implement in the sketches.

While not being a presentation specifically meant for our minor, the talk Eva gave will be of great influence for all of the future events we visit.
